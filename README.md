It is a very common issue to come across websites with an ugly font for Arabic, or text at a size that makes it uncomfortable to read. These two problems compound, and make it almost impossible for students of Arabic to read online.

*Qari* aims to change that, by being a beautiful and simple reader. Paste in Arabic, get a crisp and clean reading experience.

### Development
This is a complete re-write of the original [`arabic-reader`](https://github.com/awrad-app/arabic-reader), using CSS Grid and the foresight into what held back the original app.

Major to-do items are in 'Issues' tab.

NOTE: the `master` branch is actually dev (for easy use of GH Pages for double testing and rapid feedback gathering). `real-master` is the branch for shipping.
